# tech-news-java-api
In this project I created a RESTful API using spring initializr as a framework template and java to create the schema model, controller, and repository to build a MySQL database to store
users, posts, comments, and votes using CRUD methods for each. Then I used the Thymeleaf dialect to create HTML files for the user to interact with the application and do things such as create
an account, create a post, comment on a post, upvote a post, delete a post, and edit a post, as will as see all posts that have been created to make a blog style website!
Due to herokus change in policy, I can no longer deploy this website for free. so I have made a video to demonstrate what this application can do.
